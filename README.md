Odin Project DVE

Hi, I'm Daniel!  I'm doing The Odin Project to learn coding and junk because I want to keep diversifying my skill set while I'm unemployed .  I think my life is going to be learning applying that to a job and then moving on to the next thing.  This time it's this.  I hope to employable in this field by my 30th birthday early next year.
